I integrated the Microcode-Patch from PC-Engine to the APU2, APU3, APU4 and APU5 to the BIOS.

The guide I used can be found [here](https://github.com/pcengines/apu2-documentation/blob/master/docs/microcode_patching.md).


The newset Bios as of writing is mainline: v4.13.0.1

I will try to update the BIOS file to the newest mainline as soon as one comes out.
